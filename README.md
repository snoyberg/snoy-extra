Various Haskell utilities that don't necessarily deserve to be published

If anything in this repository looks truly interesting, ping me about it, and
I'll consider releasing it as its own package (or with some other package).
Additionally, anyone is more than free to take some code from here and create
their own package out of it, I only ask that you let me know so that I can
reference that package (and likely use it myself).
